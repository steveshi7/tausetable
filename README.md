# Tause LED Table Project

This is the repository for Cal Theta Tau, Epsilon Chapter, Rho Pledge Class's engineering project, a LED table for the house.

We utilized NeoPixel Strips to implement lighting, and programmed them with the [FastLED Library.](http://fastled.io/)

The button input used is the [1x4 Membrane Keypad.](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1332), which contains five pins. This is represented by a LED in the circuit diagram. The first pin is connected to GND, while the other 4 are connected to pins Arduino pins 3, 4, 5, and 2, corresponding to each button respectively.
